It lets you stand your phone up on an airplane tray table to watch a movie. When you're done, it collapses flat like your bangs in a rainstorm. Did we mention each PopGrip includes a swappable PopTop? Leave commitment at the door by switching out your PopTop for another, whenever the mood strikes. Or remove it completely and get your wireless charge on.",
